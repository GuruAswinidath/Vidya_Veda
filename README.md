# üìö VidyaVeda ‚Äì Empowering Learning with Personalized AI

üöÄ **Overview**  
This project proposes an innovative mobile application that leverages Generative AI (GenAI) to personalize the learning experience for students. The app tackles the challenge of information overload by allowing users to specify a topic and then curating relevant video lectures with timestamps for specific subtopics. GenAI further personalizes learning by generating clear and concise notes from video lectures and uploaded PDFs. Interactive quizzes tailored to the chosen concept solidify understanding, while performance analysis reports provide valuable insights into strengths and weaknesses. This app empowers students to become active participants in their education by fostering personalized learning, enhanced efficiency, deeper understanding, and self-directed learning.

### **File Descriptions and Program skeleton**

Please Refer `vidya_veda.py` file

#### `video_processor.py`
Contains the `VideoProcessor` class for recommending videos and generating summaries based on video transcripts. It fetches transcripts from external APIs or local databases for further processing.
```bash
class VideoProcessor:
    # video_data  # stores the recommended videos for a topic
    # transcripts  # stores the video transcripts

    def recommend_videos(topic):
        #Function to fetch and recommend videos based on the input topic.
        #It connects to external APIs or local video databases and filters the most relevant content.
        pass

    def summarize_video(video_id):
        #Function to generate a summary of a video by fetching its transcript and using NLP models to summarize it.
        pass

    def fetch_transcript(video_id):
        #Function to extract the transcript of a video using the OpenAI API or another service.
        #This transcript will be used for summarization and quiz generation.
        pass
```


#### `quiz_generator.py`
Defines the `QuizGenerator` class, which creates quizzes from provided topics or video summaries and evaluates student answers. It provides personalized feedback based on performance.
```bash
class QuizGenerator:
    # quiz_questions  # stores the generated questions for the quiz
    # quiz_answers  # stores the correct answers for evaluation

    def create_quiz(topic):
        #Function to generate quiz questions based on the summarized content of the videos or input topic.
        #Uses templates or predefined formats for multiple choice questions (MCQs).
        pass

    def evaluate_quiz(student_answers, correct_answers):
        #Function to evaluate the student's answers by comparing them to the correct answers.
        #Returns the score and feedback based on the student's performance.
        pass
```

#### `ai_chatbot.py`
Implements the `ChatBot` class that powers the interactive AI chatbot. The chatbot leverages large language models to respond to student queries and handle follow-up questions.
```bash
class ChatBot:
    # chatbot_model  # stores the pre-trained large language model for answering queries

    def __init__():
        # Initialize the chatbot model with an LLM
        pass

    def ask_question(topic):
        #Function that allows students to ask topic-related questions.
        #Uses a language model to generate answers based on the provided context.
        pass

    def handle_follow_up(question):
        #Function that handles follow-up questions from students based on previous answers.
        pass
